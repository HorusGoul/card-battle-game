## How To Play

<ul>
  <li>Special cards: Jack (1), Queen (2), King (3), Ace (4).</li>
  <li>
    It's a turn-based game. Players have to play cards in each turn.
  </li>
  <li>
    If somebody played a special card in the previous turn, you'd need
    to play a maximum of 4 cards (in case of being an ace).
  </li>
  <li>
    To counter a special card, you need to be lucky and play another
    special card. If you only throw common cards, the last player who
    played a special card wins all the cards that are in play.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the last two cards played have the same value, that's considered
    a pair. The first one to announce it wins the round and all the
    cards that are in play.
  </li>
  <li>The player that manages to get all the cards wins the game!</li>
</ul>
